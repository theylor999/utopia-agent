/**
 * Interactive recorder — explicit request from the owner: instead of always
 * having to manually rediscover selectors, he records a procedure by clicking on the
 * app's real window (never a video — the output is a FILE, `procedures.json`, in the
 * same format `runProcedure`/`npm run replay` already knows how to play back).
 *
 * Does NOT assert anything (it's not a regression test) — opens the isolated app (the
 * same always-empty e2e profile), goes through onboarding on its own (via
 * `quickLogin`, real clicks, doesn't count as part of the recorded procedure
 * because the recorder is only injected AFTERWARD), and hands over control: the owner
 * interacts with the window normally. Saves incrementally to
 * `procedures.json` every 2s (Ctrl+C in the terminal at any time is
 * safe — nothing is lost) and also when the maximum time is reached.
 *
 * Run: npm run replay:record --name=procedureName
 * (default name if `--name` isn't passed: `gravacao-<timestamp>`)
 * (default minutes 15, adjustable with `--minutes=30`)
