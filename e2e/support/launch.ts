/**
 * Isolates the data dir in a temporary folder, to guarantee ZERO contact with the
 * owner's real profile (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Utopia Agent` on Windows, `~/.local/share`
 * on Linux, etc.).
 *
 * REAL BUG CONFIRMED IN THIS SESSION (found by the owner, running live): the
 * previous version of this file overrode `APPDATA` (the Roaming folder) on
 * Windows, but Tauri's `app.path().app_local_data_dir()` resolves via
 * `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (the Local folder) — a DIFFERENT variable, never touched. The
 * isolation never actually worked on Windows: every e2e run opened
 * against the owner's real profile, with real projects/repositories. Confirmed
 * empirically (`%APPDATA%\Utopia Agent` doesn't even exist;
 * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Utopia Agent` is where the real data lives).
 *
 * Fix: uses `UTOPIA_AGENT_APP_DATA_DIR`, the explicit override that BOTH
 * `resolve_tauri_data_root` (desktop) AND `resolve_standalone_data_root`
 * (`utopia-agent-server`) check BEFORE any OS-specific resolution
 * (`src-tauri/src/profiles.rs`) — doesn't depend on guessing which environment
 * variable the OS/Tauri actually consults on each platform. Keeps
 * `HOME`/`APPDATA`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` as reinforcement isolation (they never do
 * harm, they're just no longer the main protection).
 *
 * The real binary is pointed to directly in `application` (never a
 * `.cmd`/`.sh` wrapper): `@wdio/tauri-service` spawns with `child_process.spawn(path,
 * args, {...})` without `shell: true` (confirmed by reading the package) — on Windows,
 * spawning a `.cmd` without a shell fails with `EINVAL` (it's not a native executable
 * for `CreateProcess`), so a batch wrapper broke E2E on purpose.
 * The isolation environment variables go through
 * `wdio:tauriServiceOptions.env` (an option documented by the library itself, which
 * arrives intact at the final spawn — `mergeOptions` does a simple spread, with no
 * whitelist), not through a wrapper.
