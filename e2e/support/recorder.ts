/**
 * Procedure recording from REAL user clicks/typing —
 * explicit request from the owner: instead of always having to rediscover selectors
 * manually, the owner can record a procedure by clicking in the real
 * window, and the result comes out ready in the same format as `procedures.ts`
 * (replayable later via `runProcedure`/`npm run replay`).
 *
 * Known limitations (v1, document rather than pretend they don't exist):
 * - `type` only records fields with a `placeholder` (same requirement as
 *   `typeIntoByPlaceholder`, the only way `procedures.ts` knows how to type
 *   today). A text field without a placeholder isn't recorded — add the step
 *   manually to the saved procedure afterward, if needed. Captures via the
 *   `input` event (each keystroke), not `change` (only on blur) — more
 *   reliable on React-controlled fields, which sometimes never fire
 *   `change` if the flow goes straight to another click without the page ever
 *   losing focus on the actual field.
 * - A checkbox/radio clicked directly on the `<input>` (without going through a
 *   `<label>` with visible text) isn't recorded — in this app they always have a
 *   clickable label next to them, but if that's ever not the case, a manual step is needed.
 * - Dragging (`drag`) isn't recorded — add it by hand to the saved JSON if the
 *   procedure needs it. Scrolling (`scrollBy`) IS recorded (`wheel`
 *   event, accumulated and debounced — see `attachRecorder`).
 * - A native `confirm()`/`alert()` is detected and ALWAYS accepted automatically
 *   (never cancelled) — the same default behavior already used in
 *   `clickAndAcceptConfirm` (projectUi.ts). The replay engine
 *   (`procedures.ts`) ALSO checks and accepts after every click, even the
 *   unmarked ones — covers the common case of the owner clicking "OK" on the dialog
 *   faster than the recording poll (2s) can detect.
